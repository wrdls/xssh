Small tool for sharing ssh config with your team members. Using etcd as the store, will support other stores, redis etc...

# Get Started
Three ways to Provide etcd endpoint:

+ command arg: ```xssh -url http://etcd:2379```

+ environment variable: ```export XSSH_ETCD_URL=http://etcd:2379```

+ store config file: ~/.ssh/store
```
[main]
store = etcd

[etcd]
url = http://etcd:2379
```

```xssh -s``` will save store endpoint into ~/.ssh/store

xssh command line help:
```

  -allKeys
    	get all keys from store recursively
  -awsInput

  -category string
    	category (default "default")
  -change
    	change host parameters
  -del
    	delete host from store
  -delKey
    	delete key from store
  -file string
    	file path
  -get
    	get host details from store
  -getKey
    	get key directory from store
  -host string
    	host: Host in ssh/config
  -ip string
    	ip or domain name: HostName in ssh/config
  -key string
    	dir key in store
  -list
    	list hosts from store
  -listKeys
    	list keys from store
  -pem string
    	private key file name, default will be ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  -port string
    	port: Port in ssh/config (default "22")
  -putKey
    	put key into store
  -rename string
    	new host name for changing host parameters
  -root string
    	etcd root path (default "/ssh")
  -s	save store configuration as ~/.ssh/store
  -save
    	save ssh config file to disk as ~/.ssh/config
  -url string
    	store endpoint
  -user string
    	username: User in ssh/config (default "ubuntu")
  -value string
    	specifiy key's value
```

Examples:
